# whitelist / pre-registration workflow

{% hint style="info" %}
latest version: **v1.1**
{% endhint %}

**Transparency** is very important to us and **we believe people should not trust open projects obfuscating their source code** in private repositories…

For what it’s worth, **poln is a new web3 project** and **all** **sources are published in public repositories!**

They can be forked and implementation can be duplicated or modified.

BTW, this is what we expect 😅
