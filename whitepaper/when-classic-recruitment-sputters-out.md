# When classic recruitment sputters out

Being familiar with blockchain technology is an important requirement creating another **pressure on the recruitment process**.

This **emerging** **problem won’t be solved by traditional recruitment** already experiencing structural difficulties with their clients (project owners) and their talents.

### From client’s side <a href="#2f49" id="2f49"></a>

**Clients** still **suffer** from :

* talents turnovers, producing loss of essential expertises and sometimes slowing down project development,
* unprofessional, unstable or inexperienced freelancers who bypassed assessments because of careless recruitment consultants,
* paid invoices for **low quality or unsatisfying deliveries**,
* long and hard claims…

… and they just want to pay and enjoy their new products, to provide new services and get more business.

### From talent’s side <a href="#a05e" id="a05e"></a>

On the other hand, **talents** **struggle** with :

* time-consuming assessments performed by unqualified or inexpert people for unpredictable results,
* **unpaid invoices**,
* isolation and the dark side of self-employment or working alone from home-office,
* continuous skills upgrade without relevant advice or guidance…

… and they just want to get paid and do their job on interesting projects.
