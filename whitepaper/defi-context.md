# DeFI context

The Total Value Locked (_TVL_) is probably not the most accurate indicator of the _DeFI_ context but it clearly shows that this pretty **new ecosystem** is **growing very rapidly**.

USD stablecoins, crypto-assets with a fixed exchange price, on Ethereum are another interesting marker of this recent growth.

It’s easy to notice that these **trends** are following the same pattern: an **impressive growth**.

The trades on the different Decentralized Exchange (_DEX_) can also illustrate this **amazing** **velocity**.

This booming expansion is very attractive but **new challenges** usually involve **more projects** **requiring additional people**.

Like the traditional IT ecosystem, _DeFI_ is actually facing a well-known issue: **the shortage of skilled, trained and vetted resources** (especially Web 3.0 developers).
