  Freelancing is booming, it’s a fact, and people want to work on projects in
  line with their expectations.

# Paradigm shift

We used to read “_freelancing is not a trend, it’s here to stay_” and “_more collaboration is happening on open source projects_”… it should be read “people are ready to work differently for a higher purpose”.

This **great energy** can fuel many **new ambitious projects**, especially those starting **on **_**DeFI**_.

**Solving** the above problems and finally fixing one of the **most important issues that **_**DeFI**_** is actually facing**, is now **possible** by building a technology, based on a shared economy, able to:

* **protect** clients and independent talents’ **interests**,
* **fulfill** their mutual **expectations**,
* fairly **incentivize** its contributors.
