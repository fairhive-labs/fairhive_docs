# Governance

**Fairhive-labs** should be, at first, the only entity to **lead the strategy and the development for an initial period of 2 years**.

After this initial period, the “centralized organization” should step down and leave the leadership to a **DAO** (_Decentralized Autonomous Organization_) and promote **Progressive Decentralization and Polycentric Governance.**

Each POLN holder will be allowed to make valuable proposals, vote and get rewards if its proposals are accepted and approved by the community, of course.

**Fairhive-labs should become a simple service provider to the DAO, contributing to the protocol upgrades as a strategic partner rather than leading the funds management or the future strategy.**

The **community must get the lead**!
