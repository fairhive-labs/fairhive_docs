As depicted in the picture, the **Client** must **pay the protocol fees only in POLN** but **can pay** the **Talent** in **POLN** or **stablecoin** (long-term missions may require mitigating price volatility).

Considering the mission stake, even if a mission has not successfully ended or the Talent is badly scored, the **Stakers retrieve their stakes in any case** (_unslashed stake_).

This schema does not only illustrate how users purchase or handle tokens but also provides additional information highlighting the escrow function : lock and secure payments.

Assuming the regular **fluctuations of the market**, the escrow can be effective against very aggressive short-term positions because **tokens are locked** for a specific duration and **cannot be traded**.
