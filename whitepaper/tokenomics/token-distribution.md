# Token Distribution

<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*EhFw99mV5Z63LwIz" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Regarding the **prime purpose of the protocol**, a large amount of tokens should be traded, in order to:

* **boost** the **business relationships** between Clients, Talents and Stakers,
* mitigate the volatility of the token price.

Depending on the amount of the stake and locktime duration, the **Stakers** (Agents/Mentors) will get **rewards from the Earning pool**.

The **team** (builders) and the **community** (DAO) will get an **equivalent share** but the teamâ€™s **tokens will be progressively vested** during 3 years:

* 30% the first year,
* 30% the second year,
* 40% the third year.

**Developing the **_**testnet**_ will be an important part of the delivery which will require a specific endowment (offer incentives for contributors).

Last but not least, tokens will be distributed:

* to **strategic partners** (advisors, media, etc),
* for **marketing** purposes (airdrops, giveaways, games/lottery, etc).
