Thanks to an **efficient collaborative matching** process putting together **vetted, skilled** **talents** and **proficient** **senior** **roles** (like **mentors**, **agents**…) into an **engaged fellowship**, the **client** can select the best plan and choose the **best** “skin in the game” **resources for its projects**.

Furthermore, through a **secured** **escrow** mechanism, the **client** can **control** the **payment** **iterations** during the mission delivery, and the different **resources** **involved** in the **fellowship** might feel more **confident** in the fact that the escrow **must have been** **provisioned** and **funded before the beginning** of the mission.

The **fellowship** is, moreover, driven by :

* mission **success**,
* an **excellent** **delivery,**
* **fair** and **attractive incentives**, provided by a **sharing economy** and **bonus** **payment** in fairhive’s **token** **POLN** (pronounced _pollen_).
