# Evaluation & Protocol fees dispatch

This **evaluation is mandatory** and is based on criteria defined before the mission starts.

The Talent is aware of key success factors and can share it with the Mentor to make sure to meet requirements.

The evaluation has an impact on the **Talent’s ranking** and its **further fellowship collaborations**.

Successful Talents and fellowships will be **promoted** compared to poor ones, raising mission delivery to success and excellence.

Assuming the mission is **well scored**, the fees will be **dispatched to the fellowship members**, promoting excellence and rewarding involvement and commitment.

**Otherwise**, reinforcing a **virtuous** **circle** approach, the fees will be **dispatched** for the **future** **DAO operations**.

The fees will be redistributed for 3 different purposes:

* liquidity pools on multiple **DEX**,
* **community** activities,
* **staking earning**.

The community activities are fundamental for the **future DAO operations**.

**Mediation** will help to **arbitrate** **disputes** between a Client and a Talent.

Community members may help **new** **members** to perform a **KYC** **process** by controlling their identity.
