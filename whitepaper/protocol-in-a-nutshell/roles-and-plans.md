# Roles and Plans

A **Client** is a project owner.

A **Talent** is a vetted expert, assessed by the community.

A **Mission** is a time-limited work submitted by a single Client on the protocol and potentially assigned to a single Talent.

Regarding the Mission, the legal agreement between the Client and the Talent is out of the protocol scope.

The protocol is a decentralized solution : it is neither a recruitment platform nor a service company…

A **Staker** is a community member who back-up the Talent and **must stake** on the mission.

At the present time, there are two different types of Staker:

* **Agent**, negotiating terms and conditions of a contract, performing soft-skills assessments…
* **Mentor**, advising and controlling the Talent’s work, performing technical assessments…

A **Fellowship** is an engaged subset of the community, only focusing on mission success.

For the Client, the Fellowship, **comprising a Talent and optional Stakers**, is the promise that everything will be performed for the mission’s success.

You may consider it like in the movie “_The Lord of the Ring: Fellowship of the Ring_” where community members assist the “_ring bearer_” in the success of the quest.

**Stakers** are “**skin-in-the-game**” with the Talent.

They should **stay involved during the delivery**.

Submitting a mission statement on the protocol, a Client will :

* **select** a protocol **Plan** (a level of service),
* **provision** the **payment** for the Talent,
* and **pay** the specific **protocol** **fees** (a pourcentage based on the Talent’s payment).

As soon as the mission is posted, Stakers (depending on the selected plan) and Talents can :

* **candidate** to the mission (if the Client allows direct requests),
* **be found** and **assigned** by the Client (if they accept direct requests),
* **recommend** community **members** for a specific role and **collaboration**,
* **build** a fellowship **proposition** with their **favorite** community **members** and submit it to Client’s approval.\

Stakers _may have no direct relationship_ with the Client.

Each **Staker role** can **group** **multiple** **members**, it can be relevant for complex missions but it’s important to mention that they will **share** the provisioned fees when the mission will be successfully over.
